CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

Nigerian Army Logistics and Deployment Readiness Analyzer

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

This program addresses the challenge of military logistics and operational readiness.
In real-world military operations, commanders must determine whether a unit has sufficient food, fuel, and ammunition to sustain a deployment under different terrain conditions.

The program will help analyze whether selected Nigerian Army units are:

    - Fully ready for deployment
    - Partially ready
    - Not ready

based on available supply data and unit size. This simulates real logistical decision-making in military planning.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

By developing this program, I will learn:

    - How to design a medium-sized Python program using multiple well-organized functions
    - How to read and process CSV files
    - How to store and retrieve data using lists and dictionaries
    - How to write testable functions and verify correctness using pytest
    - How to model a real-world problem and convert it into logical program steps
    - How to improve code readability, structure, and error handling

4. What Python modules will your program use?

The program will use the following Python modules:

    - csv :- to read unit and supply data from CSV files
    - datetime :- to handle deployment dates and timelines
    - pytest :- to test selected program functions
    - math :- for calculations if needed
    - os :- for file handling during testing

5. List the names of functions you will need?

The program will be divided into multiple functions, each performing a single task:

    - read_dictionary(filename, key_index)
    - calculate_food_status(soldiers, food_days)
    - calculate_fuel_status(fuel_liters, terrain)
    - calculate_ammo_status(ammo_units, soldiers)
    - determine_readiness(food_ok, fuel_ok, ammo_ok) 
    - generate_unit_report(unit_data, supply_data)
    - main()

Most of these functions will take parameters and return values, making them reusable and easy to test.

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.

The following test functions will be written and executed using pytest:

    - test_calculate_food_status()
    - test_calculate_fuel_status()
    - test_calculate_ammo_status()
    - test_determine_readiness()

These tests will ensure that the program's core logic works correctly under different conditions.
